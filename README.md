# Ollibraria
Ol'Libraria is an web application for customer to buy books, and for the shop owner to manage books. This website was made by ASP.NET and was developed with Domain Drive Design (DDD) architecture. Which means this application uses layers such as:

1. View -- to show information to the user and interpret their commands.
2. Controller -- to validate all input from the view layer.
3. Handler -- to handle all business logic required in the application such as query from database.
4. Repository -- to give access to the database and model layer by referencing preexisting domain objects.
5. Factory -- for encapsulating all complex object creation.
6. Model -- for representing concepts in the business, and their relations with one another.

Ol'Libraria was made in Visual Studio, uses SQL Server Express LocalDB, means the database is included within the project and there's no need for external connection. This web application also incorporates features such as input validation that will be triggered if a user entered an invalid input.
